        <p class="biotext">Connor is the team's head programmer and the "Go to fix it program" guy and is fluent in
            LabView and RobotC. Connor and Devan are the team's two programmers and have written all of the team's code.
            Connor has attended the Odyssey Institute for three years and has participated in FLL for the first year and
            FTC the last two years. Even though Connor's number one choice on the team isn't to drive, he sure makes a
            great effort to try his hardest when he has to. When Connor is older he hopes to be a computer scientist for
            Google.
